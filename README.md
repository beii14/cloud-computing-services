<h2>What is Cloud Computing for you?</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is like having your own powerful computer, but without needing to own or manage the physical hardware. Instead of storing files and running applications on your local computer, you use the internet to access powerful servers and services managed by cloud providers. This way, you can do more with less!</p>
